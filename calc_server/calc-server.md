# Calculator Server
## Project Requirement
We are going to use Go's built-in package `net/http` to create a calculator server. The server 
should have 4 API endpoints, each endpoint serves a different mathematical operation. For example,

* `api/add` does addition
* `api/sub` does subtraction
* `api/mul` does multiplication
* `api/div` does division

Each endpoint takes in 2 query parameters, left operand and right operand, denoted by `lop` and 
`rop`.

## Create routing
Coming soon...

## Bonus
Add more endpoints for practice!
