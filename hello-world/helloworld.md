# Hello World

By now you should have your Golang installed, your workspace created, and your `$GOPATH` configured. It's time for hello world.

## Setup

Create a folder named `helloworld` in the `go-academy` directory. Then create a `main.go` inside the `helloworld/` directory.

```text
WORKSPACE/
    src/
        go-academy/
            helloworld/
                main.go
```
