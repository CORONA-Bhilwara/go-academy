# Introduction

This is a tutorial that aims to build on top of the materials from Go Tour. It approaches learning Go through building little projects. It begins with simple hello world program and concludes with full stack application using Go back-end and React/Redux front-end. This is also a repository for me to share my notes on more advanced Golang patterns and techniques.

## Prerequisite - Go Tour

For those who are interested in learning Go, please head to [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/) and complete the **Basics** and **Methods and Interfaces** sections of the Go tour. Readers are not expected to have Golang syntax memorized right away. I believe that the best way to learn is to build.
