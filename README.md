# [Go Academy](https://calvinfeng.gitbook.io/go-academy/)

This is a tutorial that aims to build on top of the materials from Go Tour. It approaches learning
Go through building little projects. It begins with simple hello world program and concludes with
full stack application using Go backend and React/Redux front end. This is also a repository for me
to share my notes on more advanced Golang patterns and techniques.

## Prerequisite - Go Tour

For those who are interested in learning Go, please head to [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/) and
complete the **Basics** and **Methods and Interfaces** sections of the Go tour. Readers are not
expected to have Golang sytnax memorized right away. I believe that the best way to learn is to
build.
