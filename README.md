# [Go Academy](https://calvinfeng.gitbook.io/go-academy/)
This is a tutorial that aims to build on top of the things you can learn from Go Tour. It approaches
teaching Go through project-based exercises. It begins with simple hello world and then quickly 
moves toward building a full stack application using Go backend and React/Redux front end. This is
also a repository/notebook for me to share my notes on advanced Golang techniques.

## Prerequisite - Go Tour
For those who are interested in learning Go, please head to [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/) and 
complete the **Basics** and **Methods and Interfaces** sections of the tutorial. Readers are not
expected to have Golang sytnax memorized right away. The best way to learn is always to build.
