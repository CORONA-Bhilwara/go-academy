# [Go Academy](https://calvinfeng.gitbook.io/go-academy/)

This is a tutorial that aims to build on top of the things you can learn from Go Tour. It approaches
teaching Go with project-based exercises. It begins with simple hello world and then quickly 
escalates to building a full stack web application using Go and React/Redux front end. 

## Prerequisite - Go Tour

Head to [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/) and complete the **Basics** and **Methods and Interfaces** 
sections of the tutorial. I don't expect you to have memorized all the syntax right away. As you 
start building projects with Go, you will become more comfortable with the syntax.
