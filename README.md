# [Go Academy](https://calvinfeng.gitbook.io/go-academy/)

## Prerequisite - Go Tour

Head to [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/) and complete the **Basics** and **Methods and Interfaces** 
sections of the tutorial. I don't expect you to have memorized all the syntax right away. As you start 
building projects with Go, you will become more comfortable with the syntax.
