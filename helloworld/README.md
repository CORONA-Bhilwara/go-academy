# Hello World in Go
By now you should have your Golang installed, your workspace created, and your `$GOPATH` configured. 
It's time for hello world.

## Setup
Create a folder named `helloworld` in the `go-academy` directory. Then create a `main.go` inside the
`helloworld/` directory.
```
WORKSPACE/
    - src/
        - go-academy/
            - helloworld/
                main.go
```
